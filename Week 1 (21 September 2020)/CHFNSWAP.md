## Problem Statement

You are given a positive elements. Find the number of nice swaps.integer <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;S" title="S" />
Consider the sequence <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;S=(1,2,...,N)" title="S=(1,2,...,N)" />
. You should choose two elements of this sequence and swap them.


A swap is `nice` if there is an integer <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;M(1\leq&space;M<N)" title="M(1\leq M<N)" />
such that the sum of the first <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;M" title="M" />
elements of the resulting sequence is equal to the sum of its last <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;N&space;-&space;M" title="N - M" />
elements. Find the number of nice swaps.
